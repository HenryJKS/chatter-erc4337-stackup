# Decentralized Chat Application with ERC-4337 and Foundry

### Overview

This repository hosts the Solidity contract for a decentralized chat application built on the Ethereum blockchain. Our goal is to create a secure and transparent messaging platform, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.

### Technologies Used

- Solidity: Smart contract programming language
- Ethereum: Blockchain for smart contracts
- Foundry: Ethereum development kit for testing and deployment
- ERC-4337: Ethereum standard for account abstraction (future integration)

---

### ERC-4337 Integration

ERC-4337 offers several advantages, including:

- Account Abstraction: Enables more flexible and customizable accounts.
- Paymasters: Allows for more efficient gas fee payments.
- Improved User Experience: Simplifies interactions with smart contracts.

To integrate ERC-4337 into this project, we will need to:

- Implement an Entry Point Contract: This contract will be responsible for validating and executing transactions.
- Create UserOperations: Transactions will be encapsulated in UserOperations to be sent to the Entry Point.
- Configure Paymasters: Implement a mechanism to pay for gas fees.
